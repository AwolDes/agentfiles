# Commits

Follow Conventional Commits: @CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS.md

Commit frequently so it is easy to use version control to understand what has happened. When working on large projects it's ok if commits are large, but try keep them logical.

# Pull Requests

Create draft pull requests early, and don't go over the top with the PR body. Keep it brief and concise, reference specific commits if they are important for reviewers. When a PR is ready for review update it.
