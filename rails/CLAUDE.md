# Working with subagents

When working with subagents it is very important to ensure they are not spinning their wheels and stuck on missing permissions, tool access, or other issues. It they are, exit early and dump context of the session to be picked up in the future, and explain to the user what is happening.

# Spec Driven Development

When given an md file or other form of plan, use the AskUserQuestionTool to clarify your understanding. Do this up to three times to ensure you understand the problem, and any edge cases. Use the questions to update the original plan file with new information.
