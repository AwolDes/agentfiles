# agentfiles
Files & setups I use with coding agents

## Worktrees

The `bin/worktree` script can be used by the agent to create worktrees, and for each work tree a different local port will be used so that multiple local servers can be running at once. It will also copy across the SQLite database for lightweight Rails projects.

## Claude plugins I use

hookify
ralph-wiggum
